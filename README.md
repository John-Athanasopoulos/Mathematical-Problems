# Mathematical Problems
-A repository with calculation programs for mathematical problems-

In this repository there are programs with which you can find the answer for mathematical problems, as finding an Eulerian Circuit for a 5 node graph, if it exists (spoiler: it does..).

## There are the following programs:
**1. Eulerian Circuit Finder**

The name is pretty self explanatory.. When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter a number of nodes. Don't worry, if it is incorrect you will be asked again until a valid value is entered. Afterwards, it will automatically will find if an Eulerian Circuit (closed path) of the said nodes exists, and if it does it will be printed as a sequence of numbers (the nodes' names are the numbers from 0 to n-1 for n nodes). Keep in mind that in order for the program to work, you will need the **NetworkX** library.

>In order to download NetworkX, make sure you have python 3 installed and your pip3 is updated and afterwards type:
>"pip3 install networkx". It will work like a charm.
